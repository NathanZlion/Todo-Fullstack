# Todo Project - Learning Exercise

Hey there! Welcome to my humble Todo project README. I'm currently working on this project as a way to practice and learn. It's a fun and exciting journey for me, and I'd love to share some details with you.

## Folder Structure

The project is split into three main folders:

1. **Express Backend**: Here, you'll find the backend server built with Express. It's responsible for handling API requests and managing all the cool Todo stuff. And I'm using MongoDB as the database to store the todo data.

2. **React Todo Frontend**: In this folder, you'll web frontend built with React. I've leveraged Redux for state management. This way, things stay organized and efficient. The React frontend talks to the Express backend through API calls, so it's all interconnected.

3. **Flutter App**: In this folder, I've dived into the world of Flutter and created a beautiful mobile app for managing todos. Flutter is just amazing when it comes to cross-platform app development. The app communicates with the Express backend using APIs, making it a seamless experience.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is for me to learn and gain practical experience with different technologies. It's a playground where I can explore and grow my skills. Here's what I'm focusing on:

- Building a backend server using Node.js and Express.
- Creating a stunning web frontend with React and Redux.
- Diving into mobile app development using Flutter and Dart.
- Making everything work together by implementing API integration between the frontend and backend components.


***This project is all about learning.***
